## General info
This is the third project which is part of the assessment for trainees in the Amalitech Graduate Trainee Program.
It is a simple web application that can calculate the body mass index of a user, provider you input your height and weight. 
This site utilises values from both the metric system as well as the imperial system, meaning it accepts height values in eighter
cm or feet and inches. Similarly the weight accepts values in eighter kilograms or stones and pounds.
